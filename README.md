# Interactive-MineSweeper
Interactive MineSweeper is a dynamic and visually engaging redesign of the classic Minesweeper game, developed using JavaFX. The project focuses on creating an interactive, animated, and user-friendly experience, integrating playful visual feedback, intuitive animations, and multiple gameplay modes to enhance user engagement.

Key Features & Interactions
🏁 StartFrame

The entry screen introduces players with a lively interface.

The mouse cursor is animated as a small man detecting mines. When the left mouse button is clicked, the animation changes to a detection action.

The Start button features a zooming and color-lightening animation when clicked.

The background includes rotating, zooming, and blurring effects, making the scene visually appealing.

Clicking the Start button transitions smoothly to the SelectionFrame.

⚙️ SelectionFrame

Players can choose between four gameplay modes — Easy, Medium, Advanced, and Custom.

Hovering over a button triggers a shaking animation, indicating interactivity.

The background uses gradient and color overlay animations.

Easy Mode: 10×10 square grid

Medium Mode: 20×20 square grid

Advanced Mode: 20×20 hexagonal grid

Selecting a mode (e.g., Medium) opens the GameFrame with corresponding grid settings.

💣 GameFrame

This is the main gameplay interface, featuring a breathing gradient background for visual depth.
At the top are functional elements: logo, mine counter, timer, pause/restart buttons, and mode menu.

Top Area Interactions:

Hovering over the mine counter displays a tooltip (e.g., “Current unopened squares: 99”), which updates dynamically.

Clicking Pause triggers different pop-ups depending on the game state, each appearing with a zoom animation.

Hovering over Reset shows a tooltip: “Click to restart the game.”

The Mode Menu allows switching between modes, confirmed by an animated pop-up.

Gameplay Area:

Hovering over a cell triggers a zoom animation, showing cursor position.

Left-click reveals a cell (blank, number, or mine).

If a mine is clicked, a pop-up announces game over, and the restart button icon turns into a crying face.

If the player wins, a victory pop-up displays total playtime.

Right-click or drag the flag icon to mark a cell. The cursor changes into a flag-carrying animation.

Repeated right-clicks toggle through flag → question mark → blank states.

After 20 seconds of inactivity, a pop-up reminder appears.

Bottom Area:

Contains the flag icon, hint button, and remaining hint counter.

Clicking the hint button decreases the hint count and briefly flashes a flag on a hidden bomb cell.

🧩 CustomizeFrame

Players can customize their own game layout with animated feedback for each action.

Hovering over text fields or buttons triggers a jitter animation.

The background features color gradients and overlays for visual continuity.

Input validation ensures logical settings:

If rows exceed 20, a shaking warning animation appears.

If an invalid bomb number is entered, a zooming warning pop-up alerts the player.

Once valid settings are entered (e.g., a 15×20 hexagonal grid with 23 bombs), the custom game starts smoothly.

Design Highlights

Rich interactive animations enhance player feedback.

Multi-level difficulty modes, including both square and hexagonal grids.

Dynamic hints and customizable gameplay encourage replayability.

Designed for smooth transitions, visual appeal, and intuitive control flow.
